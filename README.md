## ðŸ§  Purpose

This project aims to:

- Evaluate how mature various countries and regions are in regulating AI in healthcare.
- Identify gaps in regulation versus AI adoption.
- Provide data-driven insights to policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Methodology

The maturity assessment model includes the following dimensions:

1. **Regulatory Infrastructure**  
2. **Data Governance & Privacy Compliance**  
3. **AI Risk Management Protocols**  
4. **Transparency & Explainability Requirements**  
5. **Ethical Oversight Mechanisms**  

Scores were normalized, weighted, and visualized to assess trends and outliers.
